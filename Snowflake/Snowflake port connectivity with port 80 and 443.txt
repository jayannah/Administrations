in terms communication on port 80.

General Information on OCSP:

The Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is an Internet protocol used for obtaining the revocation status of an X.509 digital certificate to 

make sure client server communication is valid and trusted.

How does Snowflake uses port 80 communication:

Snowflake uses Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) to provide maximum security to determine whether a certificate is revoked when 

Snowflake clients attempt to connect to an endpoint through HTTPS.

Snowflake uses OCSP to evaluate each certificate in the chain of trust up to the intermediate certificate the root certificate authority (CA) issues. 

Ensuring that each certificate is not revoked helps Snowflake to establish secure connections with trusted actors during the identity verification 

process.

Important Note:

There is no authentication traffic traversing through port 80.
